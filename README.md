### Notes
For a while, I worked to resolve the issue of the table view's scrolling bar not hugging the right side of the screen. I did not solve the issue, but I hope to continue troubleshooting when we work on part 2 next week. I am excited to learn about Auto Layout to create apps that are responsive on all different screen sizes!
